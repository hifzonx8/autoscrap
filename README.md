# hifzonx8/autoscrap
A program with the sole intention to scrape logammulia precious gem price, scheduled by vercel's cron. The core scraping functionality is available on [hifzonx8/scraped-gold](https://github.com/hifzonx8/scraped-gold),
this repository contains different version of the scraping mechanism that has minor changes in order to suit the need for my use case, which is storing the price to a database.
